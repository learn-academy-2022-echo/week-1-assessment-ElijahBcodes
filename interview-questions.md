# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:
.

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github? 
Your answer:Git is the Global Information Tracker. Was designed to help organize and compartmentalize projects into smaller tasks that can be divided and completed indipendently and then merged together to complete a project on the main timeline. Before people would code through the whole project step by step. Github is where we share, review, and process the data sent by git.




Researched answer:
Git lets you make and keep track of changes made on a code project. We used the git to work on coding challenges in pairs where one person is driver and the other is a navigator. I could definetley see how this could make bigger projects easier to complete if we are able to handle small parts of the project without affecting the main code until our changes are reviewed. This would help protect the source code so that we do not break the whole thing. All the changes can be reviewed before they are implemented. GitHub is where we can manage and view the git repositories.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: The operators that will return a Boolean value in javascript are true,false, ===, ==,!=, >, <, >=, <=

Researched answer:
The javascript operators that will return a Boolean value are useful because they allow us to compare data and then execute based on the output of that comparison.The opertatos that return true or false (Boolean) are; relational (<,>,<=,>=), Equality (strict ===, loose ==), and Logical (&& , ||, and !).
3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value? 

Your answer: An index is location or position of a data type in a array. The index is the location and the value is the data stored at that particular index.

Researched answer
 In JavaScript an index is adddress to contain the location of data in an array or string. Value is the data at a given index in an array. We often use this to check what data is being stored and logged in the correct place. We can also find where data has been stored which would be helpful if we need to retrieve that data.

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: It is repeating a process until we are given instructions to stop. Loops iterate through a set of data until it finds a true statement.

Researched answer: Iterations is repeating a proccess a certain number of times. The iterator in for loops tells us what direction we are going through the data positive or negative.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming is done using git and github via the terminal. This is helpful because it gives an extra pair of eyes to code through challenges or problems. The person doing the coding and  is called the driver. This person will pull the repo and clone it down, create a new branch and code. The navigator is the other person watching what the driver is coding and giving instructions as to what code is being input. The navigator does not code they only dicatate so the driver can input. This makes it more efficient as one person can focus on the task while the other is focused on the code.what

Researched answer: Pair programming involves two people working on one source code collaboratively to make one program. The idea is that two heads are better than one. When dealing with complex problems two people can pool together their knowledhe base to make better or faster solutions. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: These are methods that are built into JavaScript used to act on arrays. They take a function as an argument. For example .map() and .filter() have built in parameters of value, index, and array. 
.map(val, index,array)
.filter(val, index, array)

2. Jest: Testing for errors through this framework to make sure your JS codebase is error free.

3. Objects: are containers that have a key and a value. Can contain several variables or functions(called properties and methods inside objects)

4. Method: A method is a function that belongs to an object."this" is a keyword that refrences the object which can be used to create a variable accessing the value in an object.

5. Classes: A type of function that contain data and actions. Classes are the schematics of objects. They have their own scope. just like functions.
